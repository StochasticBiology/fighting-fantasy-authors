Success probabilities of Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, plotted by author

Source data and R script to compute and visualise statistics of success probability in Fighting Fantasy gamebooks.

Needs R with ggplot2 and ggrepel packages.

Source data is a summary of the excellent calculations and solutions by user "champskees" here https://fightingfantazine.proboards.com/board/30/fighting-fantasy-solutions.

Additional: wofm.c is a simulation of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain with minimum stats. This is a WIP and may contain bugs (it gives a different output to others!)
